Install and setup an app on Ubuntu Linux - OpenCog

Here is the url:

-- I just don't know how to turn it on, and start talking to it.

------------

(1) Set this up on your machine

- Get it running - Talk to it a little - make sure it works - update it with what you talked about so far - talk to it a little - make sure it works ...

Use this link:
https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Building_OpenCog



(2) THEN - walk me through the process

(a) Walk me through it over the phone or (b) in a simple text file - or (c) give me a script to run - with simple/good comments on what to do to get to the talking part


---------------

APPLICATION INFO:

It's called OpenCog. It's just for Ubuntu Linux.
It's a talking - 'General AI' computer - so you can have conversations with it. He built a Robot that uses this software to speak and understand if you're happy or sad, and then it responds back to you - based on what it has learned so far. It learns and gets better as time goes on.

------------

NOTE: Last thing:

Please make sure to comment in the linux script - how to run the process that updates what it has learned so far - since you ran the update last.
I want to know how to do that easily as well.

Thank you. :)

The budget:
My goal is to pay a max budget of $100.

Let me know if you need more - talking max more of $100 ... and if you still need more ... the very max I am willing to go is $1000, only if it is complicated for you to set it up.

So ... if it's easy and you can do it in a few hours - we can keep it at $100.

What do you think about the project?

Do you like it enough to do it? And if so, how much would you charge me?

Let me know...
