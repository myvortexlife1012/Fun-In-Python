I could do it in mycosmicdna - everyone would have a color - we could determine the color in 10 ways - so there would be 10 colors - you could choose from -

and you get something cool from it
-it converts it into - 1perspective-weird, from a geek about functions

-- based on your a days (datetime place-lat-long) you are in - always psychologically arriving at simple choices for the color to be

somehow we make the color cool - no matter what is - maybe we make it look like gold bars in their color - something cool

create - date - to color - converter

logic and pyschology - chooses the color
based on the birthchart planets in the chart

every sign gets a certain color - and a color value

you add them up and then choose the color

but it outputs just 1 color
from one full birth date - including your location

astrology - date -- to color - using simple but good logic to select the color

it would be cool to have this

maybe it could make other random things easier

have some easy data - to a logically selected color

so weird

it could be really helpful
