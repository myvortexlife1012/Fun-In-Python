I need a hair shadow - so I can remove all hair shadows from each hair
--
hair is 2 pieces, the front and the back (shadow) - that is seen under the ears

---

if the hair was transparent - using the multiply setting

each hairstyle
gets it's own white face body, shaped correctly
-and when we combine - it will pull it in, so the face features can be on top and then then hair on the very top layer

just use their feature variations
and that's it

generate it at as low of resolution as possible

in a 500x500 image

do it quick and dirty in photoshop
-select just the elements - copy and paste onto the page - go fast

see if the girls look ok, being generated -- how does it look?

just use one face as a body

the elements are eyes, nose, and mouth - real only?
