Overview
--------
Most of the basic components used in OpenCog are distributed across
various git repos, (mostly) grouped under https://github.com/opencog

This git repository contains a crude natural language processing
pipeline, several embodied chatbots, and some control/action-selection
mechanisms.  These include:

* Ghost, a Chatscript-compatible chatbot with additional capabilities
  for accepting visual sensory input, and for controlling robot
  movements.

* OpenPsi, a model of psychological states. Its currently a mashup of
  two unrelated ideas: a generic rule-class action-selection and planning
  system, and a model of human psychological states. An open to-do item
  is to untangle these two.

* An assortment of natural language processing subsystems, including:
  * Natural language generation (for expressing thoughts as sentences).
  * Natural language input (for reading and hearing).
  * Relex2logic, converting natural language to logic expressions.
  * Assorted chatbots, some of which are embodied.
  * A Lojban tool.
