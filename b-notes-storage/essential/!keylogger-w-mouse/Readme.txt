I need to map what I'm doing

in a way that can exactly be played back - exactly - with zero modifications

the output of what I'm doing has to be - SO PLAIN--so SMALL

output like this:

...


final output like this:

max-res: 1900 x 1200 ... (wide, tall)
click--right x-y: 800 x 750 ... (across, up&down)
click x-y: 790 x 748
type:M ... (type only does letters or numbers)
type:i
type:c
type:h
mouse x-y: 750 x 800
type:a
type:e
type:l
type: 
mouse x-y: 750 x 800
type:S
type:t
type:o
type:n
mouse x-y: 750 x 800
type:e
type: 
type:e
type:pressed:backspace
type:e
type:pressed:left-arrow
type:del
key combo:ctrl+a
key combo:ctrl+c
/* then I go to open something else - to paste it in */
mouse x-y: 750 x 800





later it needs to do the same thing - so things need to be in the same positions - everything that is ever clicked on - MUST BE IN SAME POSITION - so full screen everything - maximize
