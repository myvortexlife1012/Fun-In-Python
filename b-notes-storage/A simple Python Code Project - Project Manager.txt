A simple Python Code Project - Project Manager

-----

I need a project manager.

I need this person for around 2 weeks.

I need them to handle fiverr communication - to a few python coders, and some kids who know photoshop.

-----



I need someone to run point - on a small software project.

It will be written in .py python code - that can run on any OS.

---

CODE NAME:

It will be called 'click()'

It will use python's ability to click on things - and convert it into a systematic way - to build what I call, a 'click series'

----

A CLICK SERIES - IS:
  - A group of clicks, keyboard input, and other code - that can all run as a set (simple and easy).

----

My goal is to automate 90% of what we do on our computers.

---

So we can simply tell the computer what click-series we want to run - with a voice command - that is the last step of the process. Until then it will be all testing - using typed commands - to call a certain click series.

---

Two such click series examples - use cases:

Example 1:
Straight Forward:

A Standard Click Series:
- another is watching a movie trailer
-- click() does all of the steps - and starts to play the trailer - in your browser

Example 2:
Advanced

A Click Series - (with other programming)
- is creating a click series to fill in forms online

---

You can see that click() can be used to do standard things on your computer

but it can also be used as a python method - to perform more complex python tasks, with additional programming logic.

ONE PART OF THE PROJECT:

I need to collect what I call the 'click collections' ... so it will be a computer screenshot - taken into photoshop or gimp - and the person measures each button - with and height - for a series of windows on that operating system ... and forms a text file - with that information

Then we give that info to the python coder - and he adds it into the click options that are available

--


Then I can generate some automation for myself - using that version of click()

And then I will tell you what we need to develop next.

--

Once I have automated about 90% of our day, and automate lots of fun uses for click() ... then I believe the project will be complete

---

I have about 20 click collections - that will need to have the button widths/heights, and x,y coordinates from the corner they are closest too.

I have some notes sketched - to provide direction.

---

Could you recommend someone who could help me?

I need someone a project manager - who understands - (1) python - and (2) photoshop/or similar program.

Then they can help me.

---

What do you think?

I have a budget of $2,000 - and I have a priority list - I can give you - I want to get a certain group of things done first.

If I give you a budget of $500 - can you get the first part done (it's the first core 10% of the project)?
