I'm looking for a SMART Python code (.py) PROJECT MANAGER

We will write some small, flexible python libraries together.

I want to make normal python coding easier for people like myself - to do more interesting python projects.

So we will be building a foundation of extremely simple functions - but that are 100% understandable (human-readable). When you put that code down - you will know exactly what it's going to do. That is the vision.

Let me know if you are interested.
