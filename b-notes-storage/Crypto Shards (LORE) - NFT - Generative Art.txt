Shards

lore

------

The shards have been a mysterious power source. But they have been lost. They were scattered all over the universe.

Now there are secret beings in search of them.

The shards contain different properties of the universe, and some of them glow with powerful energy.

There are stories that are starting to spread that they have found a shard locator. There will be elite teams gathered to take their spaceships and travel in the universe to obtain them.

A powerful evil overlord wants to gather them so he can rule the universe, and do everything he wants - at the expense of the others living in it.

There is an old, and very wise good overlord that wishes to create a network of harmony all over the universe.

And so there are competing interests around these hidden shards.

The power of the shards are potent and stories talk of legendary shards that can help the user create anything they want and materialize their dreams - manifest it right before their eyes.

Who will gain the power of the shards? How will the shards be used? Will the good guys in the universe get to them first?
Will there be a battle of the shards, as they are found, recovered, and studied.

We shall see, as time progresses.
