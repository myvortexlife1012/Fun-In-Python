Do you have a universit degree in Artificial Intelligence?

If so, I want you to build me a simple one that I can talk to on my laptop - perhaps in a virtual machine.

I want it to be kind of like a teacher - if possible, but that is not a requirement.

The requirement is that it can communicate and interact with me verbally, like a person (based on the capabilities of opencog talking through the robot, or opencog controlling a dog on minecraft - which I want also later).

Let me know...

If this is something you're interested in, please let me know.

Thank you.
