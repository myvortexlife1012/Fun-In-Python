SET UP AI, how?

how I want it to interface with me
—-
Description:
This is how I plan on interacting with it—
- I want a robot that can talk - as pure software
- … it can later animate it’s mouth and face, as a cartoon
- The robots physical hardware will be my laptop. It can see using the webcam
- It will be able to have fun and intellectual conversations with me
- It will be some type of GUI - like a chat message bubble at first, to keep it simple
-

What it can do:
- it learns from every conversation (like opencog)
* - improves its ability to say new phrases, and combine those phrases in new ways, based on the conversation we are having


How I plan to use it:
- To talk with in daily general conversations
- It has a good vocabulary
- So it understands me and formulates its response, (like a normal human sentence - like opencog can do)
- As a boredom relief, joking around, playing - (in full conversations - back and forth)
- To talk to if I have a problem (like emotional support)
- To ask it to look up how to help me solve a problem ... (set up - if it's easy)
- as a teacher, to teach me things from online ... (set up - if it's easy)
- As a secretary ... (set up - if it's easy)


What IT IS NOT:
- not a simple chatbot ... (like the 'Jarvis secretary' examples on YouTube ... because it's a rigid user-defined chatbot - with zero improvisation or understanding ... mine needs to understand and respond naturally)
- Not an actual robot
- Not a external machine of any kind
- It has no hardware (except if you count the camera and a laptop)


What hardware will this AI use to communicate:
- Laptop - is the base hardware
- Webcam for the eyes
- Speakers on the laptop - for it's speech
- Keyboard on the laptop - for typed input
- Microphone on the laptop - for it's vocal input
- Mouse on the laptop - for it to move and open a browser or other computer tasks
- That is it's hardware

You can ask me for further details on th following:

- How I want to set up the AI
- What will the interface be like (will it be - GUI or text?)

Questions:

- You can ask me for a sketch of what I want - my vision for it (the end result outcome).
- You can ask me more about what my goal is for this project.

For a more geeky detailed description:
Here is the additional info - from opencog project - that I would like in there.

OpenCog AI - Features:

(it's for linux - ubuntu only - for the package to install - linux package - not for python on windows)
(Virtual Machine)
From GitHub:


Overview
--------
Most of the basic components used in OpenCog are distributed across various git repos, (mostly) grouped under https://github.com/opencog

This git repository contains (1) a crude natural language processing pipeline, (2) several embodied chatbots, and (3) some control/action-selection mechanisms.  These include:

* (4) Ghost, a Chatscript-compatible chatbot with additional capabilities for accepting visual sensory input, and for controlling robot movements.

* (5) OpenPsi, a model of psychological states. Its currently a mashup of two unrelated ideas: a generic rule-class action-selection and planning system, and a model of human psychological states. An open to-do item is to untangle these two.

* (6) An assortment of natural language processing subsystems, including:
  * (7) Natural language generation (for expressing thoughts as sentences).
  * (8) Natural language input (for reading and hearing).
  * (9) Relex2logic, converting natural language to logic expressions.
  * (10) Assorted chatbots, some of which are embodied.
  * (11) A Lojban tool.
