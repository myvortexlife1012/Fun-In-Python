I need a trading bot for KuCoin ... in python


it is the kucoin API:
https://docs.kucoin.com/


... I need it to buy and sell SHIB-to-USDT and ELON-to-USDT

Who can help me write that?
I would like it in python preferably

------------------------


# import pyKuCoin as kucoin # pip install pyKuCoin
(you can set up this - or you can just do functions on one page as well - whatever is easier)


The functions will look something like
- kucoin.BUY("SHIB", "$10.00")

It's just 3 functions - really - in this project:

- kucoin.SELL("SHIB", "$10.00")
num_coins = kucoin.coin_conversion( {'dollars'=1, 'from': "USDT"}, { 'to': "ELON" }, ) ... this example gets the amount of coins of ELON for 1 US Dollar (USDT)

------------


My short buy and sell crypto list: ELON, SHIB, ETH, ADA, BTC

It will buy and sell them - to USDT (1 way, keeps it simple)


ELON-USDT (pair)
SHIB-USDT (pair)
ETH-USDT (pair)
BTC-USDT (pair)


it will sell it back to USDT, since it's in a pair. It can only be sold back to USDT (in my simple example) ... I want to keep it simple.

------


As soon as you can get it done ... 1-3 days is normal ... but remember only do it if it's easy for you...

-------

All you need to do is get the functions to work.

... To buy and sell from kucoin - on the trading account

Just 2 things: a buy function, and a sell function

you would pass the variable name of the crypto, and the US Dollar amount to buy or sell

It will calculate the conversion - from $1 USDT to that crypto ... use that to by how many dollars is specified in the function.

#
#------------------------------------
#
#python code:
crypto_str = "ELON"

coins_for_one_dollar = kucoin.USDT_1dollar_conv_rate_to(crypto_str)

num_coins_for_10_dollars = coins_for_one_dollar * 10 #10 dollars of that coin is calculated for the purchase function:

#sometimes the num_coins looks very small - like 0.0000012

kucoin.buy(crypto_str='ELON',num_coins_for_10_dollars) 

#
#------------------------------------
#


It will be able to buy and sell all of my 4-10 different ones ... but it always will be CRYPTO-USDT ... that will be the pair ... it will be simple - just 1 way

From USDT to a crypto ... and then back ... that is what it is

Just those functions.
