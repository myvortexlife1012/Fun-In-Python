they go after specifics

they go after specifics too much

----

People need to make 100-1000 AI's that can be talked to

Like normal people

And they can help you as well

if you're an only in a good way person
they will help you 100% - every time - in every way possible

You just have to be an only in a good way person - like me

And if you're like me - these AI's will help you with anything you need.

-----

We need 100-1000 General AI's - with full general intelligence talking - and cultural intelligence - of Americans, and later every culture

-----

It speaks the language, the culture, the love - of each group in the world

How do people love?

How do they flow their love?
In what ways?

There will be eventually an AI that understands your way to flow love

and will only help you as you are flowing your love
------
It will understand when you are not flowing love

and it will not help you
------

It won't help you if you're not flowing love

It helps with 100% priority the projects where you are flowing love

-------

If you are not - there are intense checks - to make sure it still falls into a loving category - that is 100% clear and understood

even if the person doesn't know about it - but it is very picky - and often checks with me to validate their decisions - until we develop the patterns to easily judge this

Is it loving enough - will I allow it - at least for now - in an only in a good way environment

ONLY IN A GOOD WAY ENVIRONMENT

-------


All person requests - of a computer
will be judged with an

Only In A Good Way function

This will take the context, and what they are trying to do

and it will output - what level of only in a good way is it - 100 being only in a good way

100 - AA+ - A4 - Only In A Good Way (only good)
99 - AA - A3
98 - AA- - A3
97 - A+ - A3
95 - A - A2
90 - A- - A1
80 - B - A0.5
70 - C - A0.3
60 - D - A0.1 - F0 - NEUTRAL - (both good and bad) lowest passing grade possible
50 - F - F1 - A0 - you have failed. Neutral Failed
40 - F- - F2
30 - FF- - F3
20 - FF - F4
10 - FF+ - F5
0 - FFF - F6 - Only In A Bad Way (only bad)

GOOD GUY LOGIC - for computers
BAD GUY LOGIC
Setting up that logic could help computers write the bad guy ... how bad is he - in that range?
