Get the 2 edge triangle - angle - of each dip and spike - as it goes up

FOR EACH CRYPTO:
show the average angle \/ ... the wider it is ... the slower it rises and falls
the skinnier it is ... the faster it rises and falls

if it's skinnier - it is more of a fun, volitile - rising crypto
if it's wider - it is a slower, more thoughtful - rising crypto

7:22p

the times of day - the V shape changes - to wider - or to skinnier

average V angle for the last ... 2 weeks (Step 2. for knowing if I should buy now)
average V angle for the last ... 2 months (Step 1. for considering if I should buy now)


- this will help the bot trade - by recognizing -- how to buy or sell - based on the fast or slowness of spikes and dips

REMEMBER:

Crypto Always Goes Up
But how and when does it spike up/down?
---
you know it's going to follow the form - you just don't know how -- crypto always goes up

REASON:
it has value in and of itself ... as a means of alternate currency - like **preselection** - people already like money -so they like that too

it's just a matter of the happy/sad up/down and when that happens - and how to sell as it's going down, and stuff like that

SUMMARY:

Never go principal - 1 easy solution
Always go proncipal - 10 easy solutions

and let your mind - only think like that

----


PERSONAL LESSON:
PRINCIPLE:
PRONCIPLE:


so when you approach a problem
you never think about a solution
you think of 10 easy solutions - and never 1

backup principle
we do not 1 machine learning
1 task
but 3-10 different ways to complete the same task, with the same final end result outcome - of accomplishing the task

--

we have backups of backups
3-10 ways to find out which happy stocks for longer (price going up), and sad stocks for longer (price going down)

the backup principle
it's covering the exception - 4 levels deep
find out if stock is happy or sad
  - do 3 double checks - using different processes/functions/logic/ each time

Don't solve the problem once
solve it 3-10 times
solve the same problem 10 times - but in a different way


---
Then you will approximate that you know - the answer

THE SCARE EFFECT - when it rises too much
-
((take into account)) the idea that when it spikes - people get scared, and

TO ASSIST
WHEN TO SELL - after it goes up, or if it doesn't go up
---
- to help - in SELLING - after it has gone up - quite a bit - or if it starts to go down more than I would like


----


LIKE CRYPTO - is the crypto liked today or not - maybe people are scared

LIKE IT OR NOT

how much do people like it - or not like it
today, this week, this month

just a way to view the data

----

eventually I can come up with reasons (patterns) *WHY* it is happening
--and build in additional logic
----when I understand more


------------


Think about time - in all aspects
we don't usually think about time - we live in tiem

Ways time can be studied so that

average

on Sunday - what section of time - did it rise the most - and the most often
on Monday - what minutes or 10 minutes, hour - did it go up the most
on Tuesday - what was it for this day?
on Wednesday
on Thursday
on Friday

all of the going ups - we mirror them - and study and predict when it will go down too


if it goes down - we need to study it going down
and be able to predict that - precisely

Will it go down - you reverse the info - and you study off of the bad examples - when it goes down the most
--when is it common - min/hrs/day of the week

----

Which Month - it goes up the most / goes down the most --- over all the years
which month of the year - are sales higher - in bitcoin
is there a month of the year - past year of data - where it rose -- over the past 12 years

can I find some seasonal fluctuation?
-------


once we have all of that long term data

before we make any decisions
start a weekly study of the crypto stock asset thingy

start analyzing it  weekly - when you want to buy it

-----

double check when -- what minute during the day -- is the crypto price moving the most (up or down)
---what are those metrics - in terms of...

from right now -- which week of the month has generated the most - stocks going up / or going down


log that

---


...10-20 more ideas here...


widdle it down - so that the decision is accurate

How time stuff has to do with 

When is the Best Time and Day to Buy Bitcoin? | Data Proof
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJFmoVJuXHc

Which 10 minute period did the stocks go up the most
which 60 minute perdiod
which 2 hours period




-----------------------





-------
you consolidate your methods
and organize - 1 layer or time

before continuing
--every couple weeks

------

find a good one to switch it into, it is rising today + the curve is ready - for a buy today
Steps:
--find a switch crypto that is rising
-first
then switch enough crypto - into new account
then back out - to sell

------


before it buys something for real - 1x
-->
-it test buys -20 successful transactions - just using data from the previous time
once it finds the right patterns - to do 20 successful data-only-test transactions

it runs the buy function and it does it 20 times - while being rewarded - for successfully - navigating the "mario level" of the "crypto stock market"

OLD STOCK DATA - OLD CRYPTO DATA
=
AI TRAINING - Gym
Obstacle Course
----------
I can use the old stock data as - positive reward training
LIKE an Atari AI training gym
---
It's going to jump like mario and avoid all of the obstacles - and do all of what is needed - to keep being rewarded - with positive reward points - for each task successfully done

I need a - list of each mini task - to be rewarded
