Photoshop - I need help doing some busy work


Here are the details ... take a look at what it is I am asking you to do: 

I need help with taking screenshots and measuring where buttons are on windows.

I have 5-10 apps that I need help copying where their buttons locations are IN Photoshop

This is for an automation project I am working on. I want to make clicks easier and automate many of them everyday.

We will be taking measurements with the marquee tool, info pallete, using the Info Window - on screenshots.

----

Measurments will be taken in pixels

I have made a video showing the exact process that I use, that you can use for me.

 - Anyone can do this, after they watch the video.
