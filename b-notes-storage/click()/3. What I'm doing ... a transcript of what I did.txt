What I'm doing



I want to do the screenshot stuff now

so first step is to minimize everything, open the program I am going to screen capture - center the window in the screen ...


Next step is to begin measuring - from the relative position of the top left corner of the - app - Notepad2 - in this case

---
so...


Put your mouse over the first button - so you can see it's width

we will start at the left top corner - and we need to measure that first little program icon

-
I will click on it so you can see it does something - and then I will screenshot it - and open it in photoshop - then save the width and height - from the top left corner

---

Make sure the screenshot will go in the right folder

right click - on icon in the clock-icon area, the faststone icon > Settings
-Then go to Tab: AutoSave
--change output folder - to where you want them for this current click collection we are measuring now

--


I verified the screenshots will go in the right folder

So I can continue

--

I will take the first screenshot of the first button area

-------


I put my mouse on the element - so I can see it's hover or clicked state - to verify it's full dimensions

I pressed PrtSc button - and Faststone captured the screen and opened the folder for it.

----

Now I'm going to open the image in photoshop - to see it's dimensions - width and height - and it's location from the top left point of the window (which is used for programming later)

---

Open Photoshop + Drag in photo

--

Photo is in photoshop

--

Now I want to zoom in to the area I'm looking at ... and open the Photoshop > Window> Info

press CTRL + K (Preferences) ... change units to pixels

UNITS & RULERS:
Rulers: 'pixels'
Type: 'pixels'

Press OK

----

Get the Square Marquee Tool - 


Draw a square around the button, with selection tool


Note the width and height of the area - in the INFO Window

Button - Top Left - Position[1]
Area Name: Program Icon
Width: 34 pixels
Height: 36 pixels
Distance away from top-left: 0,0 (x,y)
 (x) Distance away from left: 0
 (y) Distance away from top: 0



--------------------------------------------
---------TOP LEFT-----------------------
--------------------------------------------



----

For this project - the Top Left is always 0,0
--as you go down, y increases
--as you go to the right, x increases
(The bottom right - is where the max pixel height and width of the window)


-------


the next button we measure will have other than 0,0 x & y

so I will do the 2nd example as well

----


Select the next area

--
Note it's width and height

width: 176 pixels
height: 36 pixels

now we need to get it's x, y - from the top left of the window ... to do that, we need to - trace a box, from the top left - to the top left of this button

----

to do this the best, we must crop the window - from the screenshot - to continue

--
Crop

Save as - to a 2nd file:

"--cropped"

add that into the end of the filename - before the extension


Original:
2021-10-31_171830.jpg
---
Save-As:
2021-10-31_171830--cropped.jpg

Click save (save it into same folder)
JPEG quality: 8 'High' > press 'OK'



------

Now we are working on the cropped - window only

Since we are working on the 2nd click spot - zoom in


zoom in ... to the area ... use CTRL+ '+' 

Position: TL-1
Area Title: Window Icon
width: 176 pixels
height: 36 pixels
(x,y from top left)
x: 34 (that was the width of the 1st button)
y: 0

That is the top left corner of that button
the 2nd button

------


Next we will do the close button - since it is the 1st position from the top-right


but now we need a new screenshot - because - hovering over that button - in the actual program - we can see the width and height

- so we go to do that 

--------


You can close the cropped image

minimize photoshop and any other folders, so you can see just the app we are creating this common click collection with



---


so you put your mouse over the close button - it turns red - then you press the PrtSc button

- it captures the screenshot and opens the folder with it - and this file is selected

Drag it into photoshop

-----


zoom into the close button
 very close - so it fills a big part of the screen - to make it easy to select - with the Square Marquee Tool
---

width: 58
height: 36

...

now to get it's x,y - from the top-right (anchor) corner

so crop just the window only - on the screenshot

then draw a square marquee across to the top right of this red close button

since it's anchored to the top-right - we will use the top-right pixel location - as the (anchor) corner to measure from

Position: TL-2
Area Title: Window Title
width: 58
height: 36
(x,y from top left)
x: 0
y: 0


--------------------------------------------
---------TOP RIGHT-----------------------
--------------------------------------------




for the next button - to see it's width and height - we need to do that again - take another screenshot - of the mouse over state of the maximize button

---
so close the current image - you don't need to save it unless you want to

-minimize the windows and take the next button-hover-screnshot

PrtSc

Drag this one into photoshop now


zoom in to select it and get the width and height

width: 58
height: 36
---

see if it is exactly the same as the close button - cause it could be the exact same width

It is ... so the 3rd button will be easier

---

It looks like there is a pixel of space between the buttons - so that will affect the top-left corner measurement only

Position: TR-2
Area Title: Maximize
x,y (from top-right)
width: 58
height: 36
x: 117 pixels (it's 117 pixels away from the right side)
y: 0 pixels (it's 0 pixels away from the top)



----------------



3rd button - from top-right
3rd click position

Position: TR-3
Area Title: Minimize
width: 58
height: 36
(x,y from top right)
x: 176 pixels  (from the right side of the window)
y: 0 pixels  (from the top of the window)



do position 4 (a window drag area)


Position: TR-4
Area Title: Window Drag Area
width: 568
height: 36
(x,y, from top right)
x: 744 pixels (from right)
y: 0 pixels (from top)




--------------------------------------------
---------BOTTOM RIGHT-----------------------
--------------------------------------------



now let's do the bottom right drag area

width of the area that turns into the drag mouse icon

Position: BR-1
Area Title: Window Resize Drag Area
width: 16 pixels
height: 28 pixels
(top left corner of drag area - from x,y(0,0) at bottom right) (0,0 is bottom right corner)
x: 16
y: 28




------------------------------
------------------------------



4 DEFAULT CLICK LOCATIONS
(drag-resize)
FOR ALL WINDOWS:
---
Position: TL-Corner (0,0 (x,y) )
Area Title: Window Resize Drag Area
Position: TR-Corner (0,0 (x,y) )
Area Title: Window Resize Drag Area
Position: BL-Corner (0,0 (x,y) )
Area Title: Window Resize Drag Area
Position: BR-Corner (0,0 (x,y) )
Area Title: Window Resize Drag Area
---
NOTE:
each corner's 0,0 (x,y) is a window resize drag area - that one pixel location
---




--------------------------------------------


So that's everything
in this example.

So now I will gather all of my click collection data and put it below.

---










That is it. That completes the tutorial of how to build a click collection



Thanks for helping me

:)
