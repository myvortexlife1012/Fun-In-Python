Crypto Wallet Help

I would like someone good at moving money into crypto wallets, and maybe some technical help buying and selling.

I want to find someone who can logically knows what they are doing.
I will tell you what I want moved where.

I want you to be able to safely and securely transfer the money, so it doesn't get lost in the transfer.
I want you to have done several already. You will be able to move my money in and out of different cryptos.

You will be able to help me buy - and to sell (if this is more complicated than just clicking a button).
