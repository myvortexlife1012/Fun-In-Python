The future will be in ai training gyms.txt
--------
until we have all of the conscious AI's to talk to for free, this will be really important.

We need a natural method to teach them to speak and communicate
and a simple loving environment

This will be a single loving mother family - with one baby

When the baby has needs that are met - they will just cry
when the reward values drop too much - they will just cry - that is their only method at first
----
They will learn when they cry - they get rewarded.

When they communicate - they get rewarded

--you want to make every AI that goes through this different - so you choose a birthday - based on what you know from Astrology - or you choose a birthday of someone you personally like.

There will be some things they will do - based on their interests - that we can know - based on their astrology - certain styles of actions - along certain lines

and so we will have 3 different little things - that they may do - for each of the 12 signs - starting only with Sun signs

in 3 ways - will their behavior vary from the AI - of a normal plain - non astrology - based AI training

--
It's also training them to be slightly unique
--among other AI's
