#create shortcut (alias) on the Linux desktop
#
#this simulates the folder or file shortcuts windows has - for Linux
#

#do it by making chmod + x - and then the file will execute when double-clicked

#it is a python file or a linux command file that opens the text editor with a certain file I want

#since ubuntu doesn't have desktop shortcuts
