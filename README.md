# Fun-In-Python

This is a group of python files to do fun things on a Windows & Ubuntu laptops.

So it will be compatible for both Linux and Windows - to use. Because I am testing it on both, to get them both working.

BACKGROUND CHANGER!
Right now the highlight is that I can rotate my desktop background on Windows every few seconds

IMAGE SAVER
And I have an ImageSAVER that saves images by any query from google images - the high res image. It does it quietly. I have a TODO: to implement it in GUI, so you can see it download 30 images - as a progress bar. But for now it just outputs the image it's downloading as a url - that it will save as.

It saves with underscores, instead of spaces, for cross compatibility of Linux.
